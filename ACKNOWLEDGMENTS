Acknowledgments:

Many people and organizations have contributed to this numerical model by 
providing code, feedback, and suggestions, or by testing the code on their
applications.  Especially thanked are Peter Bannon, Johannes Dahl, Nathan 
Dahl, Chris Davis, Dan Dawson, J. Michael Fritsch, Matthew Gilmore, Richard 
James, Anders Jensen, Teddie Keller, Daniel Kirshbaum, Joe Klemp, Ted Mansell,

Straka, Mark Straka, Gregory Thompson, Lou Wicker, and Bob Wilhelmson.  

Some code in CM1 was adapted from other numerical models, including:

- The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model
  (land-surface model, surface layer model, ocean mixed-layer model, 
   several microphysics schemes, rrtmg radiation scheme)

- The Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), which is developed by the 
  Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms at the University of Oklahoma
  (atmospheric radiation codes)

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has supported George Bryan during the 
development of this code through grants ATM-9806309 and ATM-0133506 and by 
NSF's support of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
