  Idealized hurricane simulation, 3D, using parameterized turbulence 
  (i.e., a "mesoscale model" type of configuration). 

  Based mostly on Bryan (2012, MWR, pg 1125).

  This case uses the "Moist Tropical" sounding from Dunion (2011, J. Climate, 
  pg 893), by default, with a sea-surface temperature of 28 C.
